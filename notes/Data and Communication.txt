The terms analog and digital corresponds, roughly, to
continuous and discrete, respectively
Data: we define data as entities that convey meaning
Signals: signals are electric or electromagnetic
encoding of data
Signaling: signaling is the act of propagating the signal
along a suitable medium
Transmission: transmission is the communication of
data by the propagation and processing of the signals
The principal advantages of digital
signaling are that it is generally cheaper
than analog signaling and is less
susceptible to noise interference
The principal disadvantage is that digital
signals suffer more from attenuation than
do analog signals
Both analog and digital data can be represented, and hence
propagated, by either analog or digital signals
Digital data can be represented by analog signals by use of a
modem (modulator/demodulator)
In an operation very similar to that performed by a modem, analog
data can be represented by digital signals
The device that performs this function for voice data is a codec
(coder/decoder)
Analog transmission is a means of transmitting analog signals
without regard to their content
Digital transmission, in contrast, is concerned with the content of
the signal
