Essay 1: Modern Day Tragedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6L_kAZ994
I would highly recommend to watch this movie because it is a classic and it is beautifully made. You will fall in love with it and cry when it is over.  
      Tragedy is a serious action and maintains a serious tone throughout, although there may be moments of comic relief. 
      &#39;The Hunchback of Notre Dame-1923&#39; is a Lon Chaney classic that has a very serious tone throughout the movie with some type of comic relief. The tyranny of King Louis XI is shown throughout this story. If people know much about French history, King Louis XI was a monstrous person who would oppress people and send them to the dungeons if he does not deem it it being &#39;God&#39;s worth.&#39; Quasimodo was a monster because of his physical appearance but who really was the monster? The tyrannical king who locked people up for false accusations and hung them daily or a man who was physically deformed but has a beautiful heart? Quasimodo gives some comic relief by the way he walks and him making fun of &#39;normal people&#39; by sticking out his tongue.
      *Spoilers*
       As the audience, you begin to feel sympathy when Jehan (Frollo&#39;s brother) tricks Quasimodo by trying to abduct Esmeralda while she walking home and poor Quasimodo gets whipped for 1 hour in the town square. Esmeralda sees his grief and gives him water. He falls in love with her and her kindness. Phoebus is a player and I believe that gives the movie a lot of comic relief. &#39;Oh look at the pretty goat!&#39; Phoebus looks at Esmeralda. &#39;Very pretty indeed.&#39; He continues to stare at her. Look at how desperate he is. Disclaimer: Phoebus is already engaged but leaves her for Esmeralda. In the second picture, he is obviously trying to sleep with her. She tells him a story and he no longer wants to do it at that second. Poor girl. :) 
      
      Quasimodo&#39;s integrity by trying to get revenge on Jehan is one of the major reasons why this movie is a tragedy.  Another major reason why this is a tragedy is because at the end, Phoebus comes to be with her while she was recovering from almost being hung and Quasimodo dies, ringing the bells of Notre Dame, alone.

Essay 2: Modern Day Comedy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_HPx6h1do
Comedy is a deviation from normality in action, character, or thought. Comedy demands that an audience views the situation objectively. 
      &#39;Arrested Development&#39; is one of the funniest TV shows on Netflix right now. This show is pretty ridiculous and it does have some drama in it. The father is put in jail for doing questionable things with his company and the whole show is the about the family dealing with it. They are very well off and now they are not. This a white collar family who makes gay jokes, racist humor, and perverted jokes to name a few. The racist humor is kind of tongue-on-cheek. It is not blatantly racist because that is horrible and it is the same with the gay jokes. Lindsay is played by Portia De Rossi (married to Ellen). The character is married to Tobias (obviously gay) but doesn&#39;t realize it and Lindsay has to act straight even though she is Lesbian in real life. I feel like I am offending a lot of people but it is very humorous. Please check this out. You have to look at this show objectively. You cannot have a closed mind while watching this. 

Essay 3: 
&#39;Sure Thing&#39;
      Plot is a summary of a play&#39;s incidents and it organizes it into a meaningful pattern. Character is the primary material from which plots are created, because incidents are developed through the speech and behavior of dramatic personages. There are four levels of characters; physical, societal, psychological, and moral. Thought includes the themes, arguments, and overall meaning of the action. Playwrights write from a point of view and reactions are expressed in many different ways. Thought is suggested by the relationships between the characters, ideas associated with unsympathetic and sympathetic characters, the conflicts and the resolutions, spectacle, music, and song. Diction is like the language of the play; the playwright&#39;s primary means of expression. Diction serves many purposes: it imparts information, characterizes, direct attention to important plot elements, reveals the themes and ideas of a play, it helps to establish tone or mood, may be used to establish tempo. Music is another example of speaking. Not every play has music but it has to do with how the actor/actresses&#39; voice differentiates while saying the script. Spectacle encompasses all the visual elements of a production; the movement and spatial relations of characters, the lightning, settings, costumes, and properties.  
      The plot is the characters changing their personalities to create a story about two people who met in a caf&#39;. The &#39;ding&#39; is almost like a buffer to prevent negative things from ruining their mood. They change their personalities to be compatible for each other near the end. Characters are two lonely people hanging out in this caf&#39; with no waiters.  The introduction to the characters were very brief. At first, the woman was acting like a know it all but then she changed her personality to make it better. The same with the guy. Thought is the action between the characters because they are forming a relationship between each other. Diction is simple in this play. It is very basic to catch on what is happening. The music in the play are the different personalities and how they speak to each other. Also the vibrations from their voices are considered music. As well as the &#39;ding&#39; would be considered music.  Spectacle in this play is the fact that they seemed like they were in a caf&#39; waiting for someone else than &#39;Bill&#39; or &#39;Betty.&#39;  Spectacle encompasses all the visual elements of the caf&#39;.  Betty would move her head sarcastically, get up quickly, act nervous, surprised, and flirty. Bill is the same way, he gets nervous, arrogant, flirty, and act sarcastically. The lightning was focused on the two characters, the table, chairs, and the book. The setting makes you feel like you are in a caf&#39;. The costumes are normal and hippy. 
      In conclusion, &#39;Sure Thing&#39; is a great play that exhibits Aristotle&#39;s Six &#39;Elements of Drama.&#39; The six elements are plot, character, thought, diction, music, and spectacle. These were shown very thoroughly in this play and it was a delight to watch.
