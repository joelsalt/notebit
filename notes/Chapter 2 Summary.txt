Chapter 2 Summary
The biological perspective is linked directly between biology and behavior. The simplest way to explain this is how our brain processes and reacts to stimuli. The brain is filled with small things called neurons. They are the foundation for our nervous system. The neurons have a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. A cell body is shaped like an egg; they can appear on either sides of the neuron. They are like the &#39;brains&#39; of a neuron. Dendrites are branching extensions that conduct impulses toward the cell body. The axon passes messages through the branches to other neurons! These neurons have a protective coating called a myelin sheathe that enhances transmission speed. When you move your arm, neurons in your brain start to have an action potential- a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon. Once a neuron fires, it is like a dominos effect for each neuron contacting another. Then there is a resting pause called a refractory period. It can pump sodium ions through the membrane. The neurons fire all or they don&#39;t. That is called an all or none response. Neurotransmitters influence emotions and movements; they interact and depending what is stimulated are the ones that happen. Every time you get hurt, there are these neurotransmitters that make you feel good, those are called endorphins. The nervous system is like the communication network (the Facebook) of the body. It lets other neurons in your body know what is going on throughout the whole system. The Central nervous system is like Mark Zuckerberg and his network of Facebook geniuses. He is the brain and they are the spinal cord. They all consist of nerves whom is connected with muscles, glands, and other sensory organs.  When you move your arms and hit it onto the table, sensory neurons go crazy!
