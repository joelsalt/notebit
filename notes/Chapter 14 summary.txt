Chapter 14 Summary

Personality is a pattern of thinking. It became well known after Sigmund Freud&#39;s theories of psychodynamics. These theories view human behavior as interactive. Psychoanalysis is a personality that contributes actions and unconscious motives. When we are sleeping, we go into a state of unconsciousness where our body doesn&#39;t respond to certain stimuli. According to Freud&#39;s weird theory that the unconscious is a &#39;reservoir of unacceptable thoughts, wishes, feelings, and memories&#39; it is very strange. He believes in three parts of our personality; id, super ego, and ego. They all cause our personality to go for pleasure principles, gratification, and internal ideals. Another thing that Freud theorized was psychosexual stages; different stages of understanding a child&#39;s development. While a child is developing they start to identify themselves with their parent&#39;s values. According to Freud&#39;s theory a child who has extremely racist parents means the child will be racist too. This identification process also includes gender identity. Children look up to their same sex parent and tries to be like them. Then they also get jealous against their other parent. For example, a daughter will try to take a wife&#39;s role and try to get the mother out of the picture. It is very creepy and weird. The personality has a defense mechanism that protects the ego from anxiety. This distorts reality and it does this unconsciously.
