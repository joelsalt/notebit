Chapter 8 Summary
Memory is one of the most important things when trying to recall information from your brain. The definition of memory is the persistence of learning over time through the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information. Being able to recall information is important when taking a test and being able to recognize information used. Recognition is looking at key words for retrieval on a Multiple choice test and being able to fill in the right bubble. Being able to relearn(ing) something quickly is very helpful, especially when relearning a second or third time.  The information that goes into our brain is called encoding. The way to retain the information is through storing it into something like a storage unit. It is held there until you need it someday. The way to get the information back, is called retrieval. In the brain, there is three places where it we can store information for short, long term, or keeping information into the brain. These three are called sensory memory, short term memory, and long term memory.  
Short term memory only holds the information for a short period of time through rehearsal. Long term memory keeps the information into a permanent storage area where it stays for the rest of our life. Then there is sensory memory, this is a very brief recording of sensory information. Working memory is like learning how to type and then continuing to use this information every day. It focuses on conscious, active processing of incoming information and how it relates to long term memory (for easy retrieval).
