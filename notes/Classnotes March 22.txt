Blah blah blah&#39;

Use the normal distribution to find the probability that a driver goes less than 70 mph. 
Normal random variable (70)
Cumalitive probability p(s<= 99%)
Mean 65
Standard Deviation 2
 Ask question in reverse: 
what is the speed so that 99% of drivers are going less than 70 mph. 
the solution is 70 mph with 1% of error. 
Z= 1.282
We have 90% below or 10% above
Call Z alpha =1.282 the critical value
Alpha =10% the allowed error
1-2= 90% the confidence level. 
Z alpha = 1.645 we have 95% below or 5% above. 
Call z alpha =1.645 the critical value and alpha = 5% the allowed margin of error
1-2=95% is the confidence level. 


As we recall from the normal distribution we can find probabilities in the form 

	P (  X  <    Z value )  =   percent

Ex:        P  ( X  <  1.282 )   =  90%
Ex: 	P ( X  <   1.645 )   = 95%


Now let us look at this the other way around, 
We define the critical value  Z?  the value of Z so that   a certain percent is below

	Namely,  we use the so called confidence critical value Z?
		Z? =   1.645     if   95% below
			&
		Z? =   1.282     if   90% below

Now, while these values could be found from our Z table (NOTE that&#39;s not so easy to do ) and/or normal distribution calculator&#39; these values are quite useful and commonly used so we will have a nice table to locate then easily at the bottom of each column where the confidence level is listed at top: 

NOTE:   area = ?  =  &#39;allowed error&#39;
 Confidence level =  1 - ?

NOTE: must decide between one tailed vs two tailed??
	One tailed means all below
	Two tailed means half below & half above&#39;.  MOST COMMON!!!

EX:  Find  Z? =   1.96    if   95% between
	Look up  0.05  on top, two tailed&#39;.  At bottom of column see 1.96
		****  KNOW REM  Z = 1.96  for  95% confident  ***




THRM:  the confidence interval for population mean is, which is a prediction!
We are (1-?)% confident that the unknown population mean will fall between

X  - Z?  s/?N		&  		X  + Z?  s/?N

NOTE: we&#39;re not proving this result, but if interested note CLT & our formula for st error.
NOTE NOTE NOTE... if you&#39;re using the online MyStatLab HW there is a program there called statcrunch and you can do this formula in statcrunch program by going ( from the top menu )
	Stat  ->  Z stat ->  w summary  (  then change option to conf interval)


EX1:	For a data set of 25 people with sample mean of 50  and  st dev of 10  find 
	The 95% conf interval
		SOL:   note Z? = 1.96  because 95% level
50 + or &#39; 1.96 * (10/sqrt of 25)
1.96 *2
SO +- 3.92
SO +3.92=53.92
SO-3.92= 46.08
	SOL after plug in find bottom limit = 46.08   &  top= 53.92
	So we are 95% confident that the population mean is between 46.08  & 53.92


We are (1-?)% confident that the unknown population mean will fall between

X  - Z?  s/?N		&  		X  + Z?  s/?N

EX2:	For a data set of 100 people with sample mean of 700  and  st dev of 30  find 
X+- Z alpha *S/sqrt of N
700+1.96*(30/sqrt of 100)
700+- 1.96*3
	The 95% conf interval
		SOL:   note Z? = 1.96  because 95% level

	SOL after plug in find bottom limit = 694.12   &  top= 705.88
	So we are 95% confident that the population mean is between 694.12   &   705.88


We are (1-?)% confident that the unknown population mean will fall between

X  - Z?  s/?N		&  		X  + Z?  s/?N

EX3:	For a data set of 100 people with sample mean of 700  and  st dev of 30  find 
	The 99% conf interval
		SOL:   note Z? = 2.576   because 99% level

	SOL after plug in find bottom limit = 692.27   &  top =  707.73
	So we are 99% confident that the population mean is between 692.27   &    707.73


NOTE the application of this is for our hypothesis testing.  Let&#39;s say for example in that last question the old class average is 700 and I now know the CI is from 693  to 707.
OK I do an experiment to try to help improve scores and find my new class grades are 710&#39;  the question is that difference significant???

The answer comes from the CI:
	If it is within the CI, nothing happened not significant i.e. my experiment failed,
	BUT it is outside ( above )the CI, then something happened and is significant 
       i.e. in my experiment it worked because 710 is outside!!!


This is called hypothesis testing and is what we will be studying for the rest of the semester, and is the capstone on MA 222 ( further your next project with PPT will be an application of hyp testing )



On project asked graph &#39;empirical rule&#39; interval 95% between x-2(std dev) & mean +2(std dev)
This is not a prediction it just describes your data set. 
But the so called confidence interval says we are 1-2% confident that the unknown population mean will fall between the sample mean &#39; the critical value * standard dev/ sqrt of N & mean + the critical value * standard deviation/sqrt of n.
