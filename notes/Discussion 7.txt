Discussion #7
ESSAY ONE
      Actors must have empathy towards others and towards themselves. They have to fully commit into performing the character in their own persona. They have to have an ability to picture themselves in different settings and have an understanding of what is happening around them. According to Stanislavsky&#39;s ideas, actors must have an approach towards making themselves challenged to play their parts. Stanislavsky trained different types of actors to develop a world from the character&#39;s point of view. The psychological strain that the character is feeling, must come out when the actor is portraying the character. When an actor cries or gets upset, the actor has to have an emotional attachment to the character in order for this to work. 
	Stanislavsky gives five contemporary approaches to acting. Those are Objectives, actions, obstacles, the magic, and given circumstances. Objectives are what the characters want to fulfill a need like Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs. An actor must invoke a response the character needs so that it is portrayed correctly. Actions is what the character does to achieve their objectives even if it hurts others in the process. Characters have obstacles that come in their way that blocks their chance to fulfill objectives. The magic would be an actor&#39;s twist on how they react to it in the real world and then portraying it on the character they are asked to play. For example, Elijah Wood used his &#39;magic&#39; when Frodo, Sam, and Sm&#39;agol were in Mt Doom and Frodo and Sm&#39;agol were fighting over the ring. He acted like it was real pain and he made it seem very realistic. As a young girl, I didn&#39;t realize that he was just acting. I thought that it was real and he was walking around the city without his ring finger. There are also given circumstances that help the actor get to know the character better. They are the who, what, when, and where of the play. It helps the actor know how the character will react when something is happening to them. These five approaches should be articulated in the active language that motivates the actors and the audience to experience the scenes correctly. 
	When there are scenes that psychologically hurt the character sometimes the actors start to develop fears of what the character is going through. During &#39;The Revenant&#39; Leonardo Di Caprio did everything he could to prepare himself for that role. He slept in real animal&#39;s fur and ate things his character would have ate. He slept outside and didn&#39;t bathe for days. He psychologically forced himself into his character and it showed perfectly during the movie. During the filming of &#39;Gangs of New York&#39; Daniel Day-Lewis had Pneumonia but still continued to film. Some of the scenes were filmed in the middle of winter and all he had one was his costume. He didn&#39;t wear a jacket so it could be as close as real as possible for the audience and for the portrayal of the character! 

ESSAY TWO
&#39;Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug in the &#39;Hobbit&#39; trilogy has to be one of the most invigorating scenes in the trilogy. Like Andy Serkis (Gollum/Sm&#39;agol), they use CGI to make their facial features appear onto the screen. Both had to pretend that they were talking to Bilbo or Frodo and they were surrounded by different props (gold and jewels). Benedict Cumberbatch had to go on his stomach and pretend that he was a dragon being menacing. He had to go through vocal training to make sure he didn&#39;t damage his vocal cords. Him crawling on the ground and doing scenes is an athletic event. He has to be in shape to act. He has to get into the mindset of the character as well. Smaug was evil and overwhelmingly insane. In my opinion, the &#39;Hobbit&#39; trilogy was a huge disappointment to many Tolkien fans and it was mostly created out of CGI. CGI is great because many actors use their imagination and innovation to picture what is going on but many old school actors do not like CGI. Benedict Cumberbatch prepared for the role by working out to prepare for the various scenes that Smaug is in. They used Motion-Capture to get his movements just right. He is using his voice as well as physicalizing the dragon to make sure that the audience is enticed and scared for Bilbo.

ESSAY THREE
The job of the Director can be summed up as being the &#39;The person who brings Unity to all aspects of production.&#39; Please explain why you think this phrase is appropriate. Use plenty of examples from the textbook.
&#39;The director decides upon an interpretation of the script and a production concept that will shape its staging. They cast and rehearse with the performers. He/she works with the designers and integrates all the elements into a functional production. The director has to decide what the performance is going to convey. Is it going to be focused on a certain character in this play? A director has to analyze and figure out how it is going to be towards an audience. The director is the main person who makes decisions on what is going to happen with the script as well as how it is portrayed across the board. The director studies all of the characters and how the director feels like the character is going to be portrayed in his own opinion. He/she consults other sources to better understand the author&#39;s point of view. &#39;The person who brings unity to all aspects of production&#39; is a director. The director is the one who has final say. 
SHORT ANSWER
Sir Laurence Olivier:

1) suicidal
2) unemotional 
3)&#39;un-empathetic-made me feel like he was making fun of people who have suicidal tendencies
Sir Kenneth Branagh:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADcMbQgCAhY&feature=related
1)&#39;unnerving 
2) psychotic (his eyes)
3) the focus was mostly towards the back of the scene. It was focused on the actor but all I could focus on was the back scene. It is probably because he was trying to hide something inside, kind of like skeletons in the closet.
