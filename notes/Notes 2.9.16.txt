Without the skeleton you would be a blob.
They also support muscles, protective of very important organs (ribs, skull, etc)
Bone and the joints create a level and that&#39;s how you move.
Hemopoieses: creating red blood cells 
Muscles: largest tissue in the body (40-50% of body weight)
Primary functions:
* Motion (reflex and voluntary)
* Maintenance of posture
* Heat production
There are three tops of muscles
* Smooth muscle (stomach)
* Cardiac muscle (heart)
* Skeletal muscle
Nerve and blood supply
* Skeletal muscles are well supplied with nerves and blood
* Receive impulse from nerve cells
* Receives nutrients and oxygen from blood
Posture:
Average orientation of body parts over time
An optimal working position is necessary for: 
* Work efficiency 
* Human well being
Awkward positions
* Less strength
* Less dexterity
* More fatigue
