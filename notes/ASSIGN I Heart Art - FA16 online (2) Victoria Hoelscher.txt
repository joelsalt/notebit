      They say &#39;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&#39; but what if beauty is more internal, something the eye can&#39;t see and something our brain continues to process unknowingly? I believe my beauty is internal. My beauty is something someone can&#39;t see even if I am wearing nice clothes or makeup. I want to feel comfortable with myself but external influences continue to bring me down. This is why I read, write, and listen to different kinds of music. My name is Victoria Hoelscher, I am 22 years old. J.R.R Tolkien&#39;s Middle Earth influenced me to follow my dreams and push myself to take a journey in life. Life is identical to the books, there are dark times, happy times, beautiful times, and the unknowing. We don&#39;t know what the future is going to hold. My life has been filled with adventure and fantasy since 1994. My mom used to read me books until I was able to read chapter books by myself. At four years old, I was able to read &#39;The Hobbit&#39; by myself. At seven, I read &#39;The Lord of the Rings&#39; trilogy. I watched the Fellowship of the Ring with my dad and continued to learn more about the series after that. In middle school I was already playing the soundtrack on various instruments. By the time I reached high school, I read the series at least 40 times, watched the movie over 40 times, and knew the music by heart. I feel like my beauty is within and when I write a story, people are able to see my beauty. 
      
Art Form I: Artwork
 
      This artwork from Alan Lee is called &#39;Hurin on his chair&#39; from &#39;The Children of Hurin&#39;. Morgoth (the predecessor of Sauron) detained Hurin and tried to retrieve information of Turgon&#39;s hidden kingdom. He tried to entice him by offering him freedom or a very high rank in his army. When Hurin refused his offer, Morgoth cursed his kin and took him to Haudh-en-Ndengin. He chained him to a chair on the peaks of Thangorodrim. Hurin was able to see and hear from the &#39;seat of all evils&#39; all of the horrible things that happened to his son and daughter. Hurin escaped from Morgoth&#39;s grasp after 28 years and returned to death and despair. His wife, son, and daughter died filled with anger and misery by their father&#39;s desolation. 
      I chose this artwork because I understand the feeling of doing nothing when something horrible happened in front of you. I comprehend being influenced by a horrible person and seeing evil things occurring because of them. My family is cursed since unpleasant events happen to them and I sympathize with Hurin. Similarly, I am chained to a chair watching my family destroy itself and looking at the evil within them. 

Art Form II: Music
O m?are henion I dh?
Ely siriar, ?l s?la
Ai!&#39;An?ron&#39;Undomiel

Tiro! ?l eria e m?are
I 'l?are en ?l luitha 'uren
Ai! An?ron...

(English)

From darkness I understand the night:
Dreams flow, a star shines
Ah! I desire Evenstar

Look! A star rises out of the darkness
The song of the star enchants my heart
Ah! I desire...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fpEJGOn2Hw

      This beautiful song is from the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack. This song is during the scene where Aragorn and Arwen are together on a bridge and she gives him her &#39;Evenstar&#39;. From darkness I understand the night is about the Sauron&#39;s influence on the world and how Arwen is influenced by it. She is the star that shines who will conquer the evil within people&#39;s hearts. She is the desire of Aragorn&#39;s life and she enchants his heart. If Sauron can get Arwen, he has Aragorn under his grasp. That is why she is very important to the story and why her father tries to get her to leave Middle Earth. If Frodo fails, Arwen will die and Aragorn would be under the influence of the ring like his kin. 
      When I heard this song as a young girl, it was similar to a light shining in a dark cave. At first your eyes hurt but then grew accustomed to its brightness. Life is like this sometimes; we are in depressing times but something or someone breaks the darkness and things are wonderful again. Life is filled with light again and the evil is pushed away. I feel like I am similar to Arwen because I am sensitive to the world around me. Everything that happens influences me and I become affected by it.

Art Form III: Cinema
      The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the final installment to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is described as the &#39;final confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting over control of Middle Earth.&#39; Frodo and Sam finally reach Mordor but will they throw the ring into the fires of Mount Doom? Will Aragorn take his throne in Gondor as the rightful king? The movie answers these questions very thoroughly. 
      This movie is part of me because I watched it with my dad. He understood how obsessed I was with it and took me to see it four times! He bought me the movie after it came out and I watched it at least five times a day. The landscapes were absolutely beautiful and the music was fantastic. The way Peter Jackson and company made the props take my breath away. I wished I was able to be in that movie someday. It is a true masterpiece. This movie influenced me to try out for movies but my mom wasn&#39;t very supportive about it. I wanted to do it but I do not have the confidence I need to do it. ROTK inspires me to follow my dreams. Tolkien inspires me to go on a journey and to go out my door to be swept away on an adventure.

Art Form IV: Literature
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
&#39;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&#39;
      This trilogy is filled with adventure and heartbreak. This passage is the first thing you see in the trilogy. This passage gives the setting of all three books. The three rings were given to Elves where they were bitter and greedy towards men and dwarfs. The dwarfs became greedy and travelled beneath mountains causing evil to appear. The men became enticed with wanting overwhelming power and fell under Morgoth/Sauron&#39;s spell. Sauron created the one ring to overpower the Elves, Men, and Dwarfs.  Men and Elves came together to destroy Sauron but the men became enticed by the ring&#39;s power. Isuldir (the new king of Gondor) kept the ring and brought Middle Earth into destruction but the ring vanished. It was found by Gollum and then stolen by Bilbo Baggins. Then Bilbo gave it to Frodo, who has to throw the ring into the fire of Mount Doom. 
      These are the stories that influenced me the most during my childhood. The battle between good and evil inspires me to do what is right even if it is difficult. I also understand the feeling of wanting to escape to get away from the troubles of the world but going through hardships is what we are supposed to do. Frodo going to Mount Doom is inspiring and the way he went through so many obstacles is what helps me get through the day. I feel like there are similarities to our world to Middle Earth. We are filled with different emotions and sometimes we let them take control of us. We are greedy, we are envious, and we are selfish. JRR Tolkien gives us a chance to sympathize with the characters and feel like we are just like them because we are. There are people who would rather stay in their homes and do nothing about the outside world (Elves). There are people who love to dig for diamonds and oil, not caring how it affects the environment (Dwarfs). There are evil people in this world who love to conquer others (Sauron/Morgoth). 

      Theatre is the one that I do not know much about. I didn&#39;t choose this art form when talking about LOTR and Tolkien because there aren&#39;t many plays about the series. There is a musical about The Lord of the Rings but it was very difficult to find a script. The music lyrics wouldn&#39;t have been enough to justify talking about it. I want to know more about theatre because I&#39;ve always wanted to perform music or enact different art for people.
